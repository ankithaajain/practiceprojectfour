        <p>A restaurant created by chef and owner Ming Joe combines traditional American Chinese cuisine<br>
             and some of his favorite dishes inspired by his birthplace, Hong Kong, made with locally available<br>
             ingredients. Ming’s Chinese Restaurant is a return to professional cooking for the New Orleanian.<br> 
             Ming’s mother, Susan, taught him how to cook Chinese food more than 25 years ago in the kitchen<br>
             of their family-owned Uptown restaurant. He fell in love with cooking there and has been building<br>
             on her lessons ever since. “Chinese cooking in America has a long history and its own tradition,<br>
             and it is changing as more people from different parts of China come to live and work here,”<br>
             Chef Ming said. “We want to honor the tradition and show where it’s going”. </p><br>
